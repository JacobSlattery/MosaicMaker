# Mosaic Maker Instructions
<h2> Instructions </h2>
<p>
  To use Mosaic Maker, load in a base image by pressing the Load icon in the Top Menu Bar and selecting an image from file explorer.
  Select the type of mosaic you would like to create, then click convert. If you choose triangle mosaic, be sure to load in a palette
  of images by pressing the Load button located in the bottom right of the window. It is suggested that a palette size of at least 12
  is used. You can change the size of the mosaic blocks with the slider to go as small as 5 pixels wide or as large as 50. If you want
  a visual representation of the block size, just flip the Display Grid switch on and it will show you. When you are done with your
  creation, click on the Save icon located in the Top Menu Bar and select a location for the file to be saved to.
</p>

<p>
  Depending on the size of the data, the program can take a little time to create picture mosaics or to load in folders of images to
  the Image Palette. It can take as long as several minutes when dealing with 4k images that are being filled with hd images in the
  pallete. For quicker load times, use small images for the palette.
